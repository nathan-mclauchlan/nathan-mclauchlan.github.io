    <body>
      <div>
      <h3 id="subheadings">What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h3>
          <div>
            <p>That there is no wrong way to learn new things there are just different ways but it all comes down to the perspective of the other team members </p>
          </div>
      <h3 id="subheadings">What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
          <div>
            <p>I feel that it means that you're kind to others around you but also yourself as you can be your own worse enemy, also you are aware of your own limitations and the limitations of others around you when your working in a team or group project</p>
          </div>
      <h3 id="subheadings">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
          <div>
            <p>That I was able to learn something new from scratch and take on bored what I'm learning and then use these skills outside of class</p>
          </div>
      <h3 id="subheadings">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
          <div>
            <p>Having an open mind and relizing that I'm learning some new from scrtach</p>
          </div>
      <h3 id="subheadings">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3>
          <div>
            <p>To give us a better understanding of working in groups and helping us learn information for when we start working to make us better workers and coders</p>
          </div>
      <h3 id="subheadings">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
            <p>Yes and no I feel like it's a useful skill to have but also at the same time I feel like the extra time I could have been practicing my coding abilities</p>
