      <h3 id="subheadings">What is your long term goal and/or carrer pathway?</h3>
          <div>
            <p>My long term goal is to take the skills I've learnt from Dev Academy and apply them to learning other coding languages so that I'm able to follow my hobbie of making video games, as for my carrer pathway I'm just hoping to get a job in the tech industry so I no longer have to work in retail.</p>

      <h3 id="subheadings">What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
          <div>
            <p>I think my biggest strength will be that I'll be able to get along with my other team members.</p>
