    <div>
        <h3 id="subheadings">An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS</h3>
        <p>I think an easy way to describe the differences is that HTML is like the foundations of a building you need to start at the base and build from the ground up before your able to add your styling, an easy way to describe CSS is that it would be all the extras you add like tinted windows and all the fancy designs you're going to add into your lobby.</p>
        <h3 id="subheadings">Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life</h3>
        <p>Doing cleaning around the house is something that everyone does on a day to day basis, the loop would be does this part of my house need cleaning and if the answer is yes you would clean it then you would start the loop again and ask the same question but move on to another room if it was no this room doesn't need cleaning you would still start the loop again but move on to the next room, etc.</p>
        <h3 id="subheadings">Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it</h3>
        <p>The easiest way I could think of to describe the DOM is that it's like a family tree showing you how everything is connected together and how and in which order things belong just like a normal family tree it starts off at the beginning.</p>
        <h3 id="subheadings">Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h3>
        <p>Arrays are something your able to use to store multiple values within one single variable for example you could say that I love pizza and beer but you could also add things like like only certain types of beer or only certain types of toppings on your pizza.</p>
        <h3 id="subheadings">Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h3>
        <p>Functions are used to enable a list of tasks into one command, so for example your playing a video game and you want to save and quit you would go into the menu or save point and the game would then run the function that would look at where you are progress wise and be ok ill make a note of that and save your game at that point then it would quit.</p>
