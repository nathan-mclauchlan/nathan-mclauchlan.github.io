                <p>I was having a tough time with some of the tests during the (Repl.it) exercise the one thing that comes to mind is during one of the tests I was stuck on and couldn't see where or what I was doing wrong until I walked away and just thought about where I was going wrong when I got back it was clear as day I was using brackets and instead I should have been using curly brackets and as soon as I fixed this everything worked out and I was able to move on to the next test.  </p>

                <p>This time I encountered many problems while trying to do the JS-Olympics, There were so many parts that were giving me a hard time that I was googling so much I thought it would break and I'd be stuck doing the JS-Olympics for days on end but I was able to soldier through it with the help of google and a few of some other the other EDA students and also some of my mates that work in the industry.</p>
