        <h2 id="headings">Identity, Values and Strengths</h2>
        <div>
        <h3 id="subheadings">Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took?</h3>
            <div>
                <p>When I was 16 I had a job working as a petroleum transfer technician I witnessed this man assaulting his partner on the forecourt she was yelling out for people to help her and to call the cops I knew right away that I've got to call the police as what was happening so wrong on so many levels as I was going back inside to call the police he drove off with his partner half hanging outside of the car dragging her along the ground. The police ended up catching the guy and his partner was ok but needed to go to the hospital, it was about 2 weeks later that I went to court as a witness and helped send him to jail. </p>
            </div>
        <h3 id="subheadings">Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity</h3>
            <div>
                <p>I was raised around many different cultures as I went to boarding school so I've always been open to new and different ideas and experiences but the underlying value from all the different cultures is to be nice and treat others with love and respect so I always try to be a nice and honest person. </p>
            </div>
        <h3 id="subheadings">Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</h3>
            <div>
                <p>I would have to say one of my major strengths is I get along well with most people and try to always be a helpful team player, limitations I get distracted easily sometimes and I'm also not a big fan of asking questions as I feel insecure about asking questions as I'm not the smartest person around and I don't like the feeling when I get the answer for my question and it was something simple it just makes me feel stupid.</p>
            </div>
        <h3 id="subheadings">Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles</h3>
            <div>
                <p>Being able to get along as a team player I think will help me overcome my learning obstacle of asking questions as ill start to feel comfortable around the people that I'm working with, I'm hoping that it will help my planning and time management skills as well.</p>
            </div>
        <h3 id="subheadings">Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why</h3>
                <p>I play online team games online where you have to follow quests but there are always those few team members who want to try things a different way because they think their idea will help us get the win but it is all about listing to your team and giving everyone a fair shot and succeeding as a team.</p>
