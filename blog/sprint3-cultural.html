        <h3 id="subheadings">What is EQ or EI</h3>
            <p>Emotional Intelligence (EI) or as its sometimes known as Emotional Quotient (EQ) is defined as an individuals abiliy to identify, evaluate, control, and express emotions people with high EQ usually make great leaders and team players because of their ability to understand, empathize, and connect with the people around them.</p>
        <h3 id="subheadings">What is IQ</h3>
            <p>Unlike emotional intelligence IQ is about book smarts. IQ stands for Intelligence Quotient, IQ tests are tools to measure intellectual abilities and potential they are designed to reflect a wide range of cognitive skills such as reasoning logic and problem solving.</p>
        <h3 id="subheadings">What makes this important</h3>
            <p>There are many reasons why EQ is very important. I feel that anyone with high levels of emotional intelligence will be generally happier than people that are not in tune as much with their emotional intelligence. People with the higher EQ will tend to be more productive in many aspects of life as they will be more mindful of their own emotions and they will be able to manage them easier in stressful situations.</p>
