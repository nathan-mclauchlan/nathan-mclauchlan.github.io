        <h1 id="titles">Id And Classes</h1>
        <h2 id="headings">ID</h2>
        <p>An id attribute is used to point towards an HTML element like h1, when you give an id attribute to an element it is unique to that speicfic element meaning that you can only use it once, whenever you give your chosen element the id attribute it will look for styles you have selected from your CSS file and will be applyed across every HTML document that is linked to your main CSS file.</p>
            <div>
                <p class="center home">As per the picture below you can see the two different attributes both have different id tags.</p>
                <img src="../images/idinfopic.JPG" alt="id pic">
                <p class="center">Now the next picture is from a CSS file showing you some of the different styles that can be applied</p>
                <img src="../images/stylepic.JPG" alt="style pic">
                <p class="center">As you can see from the picture examples the headings and subheadings both have different styling effects that are going to change their look.</p>
            </div>
        <h2 id="headings">Class</h2>
        <p>Now the class attribute is like the id attribute but unlike the id your able to use multiple classes on one element the benefit of this is that you can have many classes that all have different style effects. </p>
            <div>
                <p class="center">As per the pictures below you can see there are two different types of classes</p>
                <img src="../images/classespic1.JPG" alt="classes pic 1">
                <img src="../images/classespic2.JPG" alt="classes pic 2">
                <p class="center">Now if we were to add both of these classes with an attribute the styling effects will take effect. The next photo is an example with both classes.</p>
                <img src="../images/classespic3.JPG" alt="classes pic 3">
                <p class="center">So as you can see there are many different ways that your able to style your webpage and make it look unique.</p>
